🥗 Smart Diet Planner – NutriLog

A personalized AI-powered diet planner that generates a complete 7–30 day meal plan based on your diet type, age, weight, height, goal (fat loss/bulk), budget & activity level.

It uses Indian regional food database (Veg & Non-Veg) and shows calories, proteins, fats, carbs, plus visual charts using Chart.js.

🧠 Problem in Real Life

People want to eat healthy… but they don’t know exactly what to eat every day.

❌ They don’t know their calorie/macros needs
❌ They search every day: “What should I eat today?”
❌ Other apps only log meals — no meal plan
❌ No Indian regional foods
❌ No cost calculation
❌ No automation

✅ What This Project Solves

✔ Generates 7–30 day meal plan automatically
✔ Includes Indian regional foods (veg & nonveg)
✔ Calculates daily calories + weekly total
✔ Shows protein, carbs, fats clearly
✔ Visualizes everything using Chart.js
✔ Personalized — 100% based on user input
